<h3 id="national-parks-heading1">Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument</h3>
<ul id="albates">
    <li>Established in 1965.</li>
    <li>Archeology site in northwestern Texas.</li>
    <li>Occupies an area of 2.1 square miles.</li>
    <li>The monument contains some 250 shallow quarry pits ranging in width from 4 to 8 feet.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="national-parks-heading2">Amistad National Recreation Area</h3>
<ul id="amistad">
    <li>The dam is operated by the International Boundary and Water Commission</li>
    <li>Record low lake level was 1055.94 feet on May 22, 2013.</li>
    <li>At conservation pool capacities, Amistad Reservoir is the second largest lake in Texas, after Toldeo Bend and before Sam Rayburn.
    </li>
    <li >Amistad Dam cost $125 million (1969 dollars) to build.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="national-parks-heading3">Big Bend National Park</h3>
<ul  id="bigbend">
    <li>The Rio Grande River serves both as the border of Big Bend National Park, as well as the international border between the United States and Mexico. Within the park, this covers a distance of 118 miles. A recently reopened border crossing at Boquillas allows park visitors to legally cross into Mexico.</li>
    <li>The name Big Bend comes from a large bend in the Rio Grande River along the park boundary.</li>
    <li>In 2012, the park was named as an International Dark Sky Park. Big Bend National Park has the darkest measured skies in the lower 48 states, and star gazing here is obviously superb.</li>
    <li>Floating the Rio Grande River, especially through Santa Elena Canyon, is a popular activity. Since the international border is officially in the middle of the river, these trips are treated as international trips by authorities, and proper documentation (i.e. a passport) is required.</li>
